    <h2>Levels of play</h2>

    <h3>Practice</h3>
        <p>
            The Practice level of play allows you to train on pictures that have already been treated.
            You are provided with the number of occurrences you have to find for each species.
            Upon submission, each correct occurrence will be saved and your score will be reduced according to the number
            of wrong occurrences you submitted, to a minimum of 50. This score will be awarded once you find all occurrences.
        </p>

    <h3>Normal</h3>
        <p>
            In the Normal level of play, you are tasked with the exploration of pictures that have not yet been processed.
            Your submissions will be aggregated with those of other players and will help players in the Expert level decide
            on a final verdict. You will be awarded a score between 0 and 100, depicting how close you were to the correct answer.
            This score is awarded once the picture you played on has been corrected by an Expert player.
        </p>

    <h3>Expert</h3>
        <p>
            The Expert level of play is restricted to advanced players. At this level, you are provided with a visual representation of
            the results submitted on the Normal level of play. Using these cues, you have to deliver the final verdict on the occurences
            in the given pictures. This verdict will then be used to correct the submissions in the Practice level of play.
        </p>

    <h2>Game modes</h2>

    <h3>All Stars</h3>
        <p>
            In the All Stars game mode, the objective is to do a very basic filtering pass on the pictures by ascertaining the
            presence or absence of each species we are interested in.
        </p>

    <h3>Animal Identification</h3>
        <p>
            In the Animal Identification game mode, the goal is to pin-point each occurrence of the members of a given species.
        </p>

    <h3>Plant Identification</h3>
        <p>
            In the Plant Identification game mode, you have to fill a presence grid by tagging each cell.
        </p>
